### About The Project
This repository contains a multithreaded Monte Carlo simulation built in C++ from scratch. The primary goal of this project is to provide a deep understanding of the multithreading process and the Monte Carlo simulation

### Features

Multithreaded Monte Carlo Simulation
Visualize results with matplotlib in Python

### Getting Started
To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

## Prerequisites

Python 3.12

C++ Compiler: A C++11 compatible compiler (or newer, e.g., C++17 recommended).

g++ (GNU C++ Compiler)

Clang

MSVC (Microsoft Visual C++)

CMake: Version [e.g., 3.10+] or higher.

## Installation
Clone the repo:

git clone https://github.com/tymoneq/MonteCarlo.git
cd MonteCarlo
# Build the project using Python main.py:
Python3 main.py

The example will simulate data inside data.in
